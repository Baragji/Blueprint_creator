Builder with MCP
Short answer: I’ve implemented a functional prototype for part of P0, not the entire P0. Specifically, I progressed P0.1 Authentication Backend, but it’s not yet “complete” by production standards. The other P0 tasks have not been completed.

Here’s the precise status by task:

P0.1 Authentication Backend

Implemented
Environment scaffolding and secrets
Created example and development env files: .env.example and .env
JWT utilities and config wiring
JWT helpers and config usage are in place: jwt.ts
Backend auth endpoints (prototype)
Register, Login, Logout, Refresh, Me endpoints implemented: auth.ts
Middleware and rate limiting
Optional and required auth middleware available: auth.ts
Route-level rate limiting ready for use: rateLimiter.ts
Service layer for auth
In-memory auth service with user/org scaffolding: authService.ts
API/app wiring
Server app wires middlewares and routes: app.ts
Not done / outstanding (blocking “completion”)
Secure password handling: currently passwords are NOT hashed/verified (bcryptjs dependency install issues led to a temporary demo-only bypass). This must be reinstated.
Persistence: current user/org storage is in-memory; not connected to your DB (no Supabase/Postgres integration yet).
E2E validation and tests for all auth routes.
Optional: session/refresh token store backed by Redis (rate limiter uses Redis/in-memory; sessions still in-memory).
P0.1 Authentication Frontend

Status: Not completed in this remediation pass.
Notes:
The frontend service expects certain endpoints/response shapes; I aligned the backend to match these types found here: authService.ts and auth.ts
No UI changes or comprehensive FE auth flows were implemented in this pass.
P0.2 DB Schema Migrations

Status: Not completed.
Notes: Migrations exist but auth is not wired to DB. No new migrations were authored/executed in this remediation step. See existing structure at supabase/migrations
P0.3 FE-BE Integration

Status: Partially aligned, not verified end-to-end.
Notes:
Backend endpoints match the paths used by the frontend service (e.g., /api/auth/login, /api/auth/register, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/me, /api/auth/refresh).
No integration tests or manual end-to-end verification completed yet.
Why P0.1 is not “complete” yet

Passwords are not hashed/verified right now (temporary demo-only state due to dependency install failures with bcryptjs).
No real database persistence for users/orgs.
No robust test coverage or e2e verification.
Recommended next steps to complete P0 quickly

Reinstate secure password hashing/verification in authService.ts and resolve the dependency install (bcryptjs provides its own types, so only the main package is needed).
Replace in-memory stores with DB persistence (models/queries aligned with your existing migrations).
Add integration tests for the auth flow and run the app end-to-end with the frontend to verify.
Optionally use Redis for refresh/session storage to align with your rate limiter pattern.
If you’d like, I can proceed with any of:

Fixing the bcryptjs installation and re-enabling secure password handling.
Wiring the backend auth service to your DB (instead of in-memory).
Running and verifying FE-BE end-to-end, then tightening tests.
