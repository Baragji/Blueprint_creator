## 3. Core Process

### Main User Flow

1. **Project Initiation**: User creates a new project and inputs their idea through the Plan Pack Creator wizard
2. **AI Planning**: The system runs the automated planning pipeline (P0-P6) with AI agents generating comprehensive documentation
3. **Plan Approval**: User reviews and approves the generated plan pack with scoring and feedback mechanisms
4. **Development Lifecycle**: Project progresses through G-Gates (G0-G8) with AI agents executing tasks and human approval at key checkpoints
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of metrics, compliance, and progress through integrated dashboards
6. **Deployment & Operations**: Automated deployment with progressive delivery and continuous monitoring

### AI Agent Flow

1. **Task Assignment**: AI agents receive tasks based on their specialization and current workload
2. **Execution**: Agents execute tasks within defined guardrails and security constraints
3. **Review & Validation**: Dual-AI review process with security and test agents before human approval
4. **Documentation**: Automatic generation of documentation, audit trails, and provenance records
5. **Feedback Loop**: Continuous learning and improvement based on outcomes and human feedback
