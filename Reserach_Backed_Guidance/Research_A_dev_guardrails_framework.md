# Development Guardrails & Quality Framework

## Core Problem Statement
**Challenge**: AI coding agents lose context over time, leading to:
- Inconsistent coding practices within the same project
- Shortcuts and hardcoded solutions
- Deviation from established standards mid-development
- Integration issues when mixing different valid approaches

## Pre-Invocation Guardrails

### 1. Coding Standards Enforcement
Before any coding agent begins work:
- **Non-negotiable standards** must be explicitly defined and documented
- **Architecture patterns** locked in (no mixing paradigms mid-project)
- **Code quality gates** established (no mocks, no fake success indicators)
- **Testing requirements** mandated for every function

### 2. Context Preservation System
- **Session continuity** - Agent must read previous work before starting
- **Practice consistency** - Same coding approach throughout project
- **Progress validation** - Each deliverable reviewed before proceeding
- **Method documentation** - Current approach documented and enforced

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Test-Driven Development Integration
Adapting TDD to current system capabilities:

#### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up without breaking tests
4. **VALIDATE**: Submit to orchestrator for approval

#### Context Management Integration
- Use existing context management tools for TDD state tracking
- Update context after each TDD cycle completion
- Maintain test coverage metrics
- Document architectural decisions

### Validation Checkpoints
**Before proceeding to next task, agent must:**
1. Submit completed code with passing tests
2. Demonstrate no hardcoded solutions
3. Show consistency with previous implementations
4. Provide test coverage report
5. Wait for orchestrator approval

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup Guardrails
- Define project coding standards document
- Configure automated quality checks
- Establish TDD workflow integration
- Create validation checkpoints

### Phase 2: Agent Instructions
- Provide explicit coding practice guidelines
- Require test-first development
- Mandate context checks before coding
- Implement incremental delivery system

### Phase 3: Continuous Monitoring
- Track consistency across sessions
- Monitor for practice deviations
- Validate each deliverable
- Maintain quality metrics

## Key Success Factors

### Preventing Context Loss
- **Explicit handoffs** between coding sessions
- **Documented state** at each checkpoint
- **Consistent methodology** enforcement
- **Regular validation** loops

### Quality Assurance
- **No shortcuts allowed** - full implementation required
- **Test coverage mandatory** - no untested code
- **Incremental building** - small, validated steps
- **Immediate testing** - validate each function upon creation

### System Integration
- **Leverage existing tools** for context management
- **Adapt TDD framework** to current capabilities
- **Maintain workflow orchestration** while adding quality gates
- **Preserve production readiness** throughout development

## Implementation Notes
This framework builds upon your existing system while addressing the core issues of context loss and quality degradation. The TDD integration should leverage your current context management tools rather than replacing them, creating a comprehensive quality assurance system that prevents the "garbage veiled in diamonds" problem.
