This is an excellent, production-ready framework that transforms your original concerns into actionable, enforceable guardrails. Here's my take:

## What Makes This Strong

**Enforceable vs. Aspirational**: Unlike many development guidelines that rely on good intentions, this creates concrete checkpoints and automation that actually prevent bad practices from making it into the codebase.

**Context Loss Solution**: The mandatory `update_context.py` after every action directly addresses your core concern about AI agents losing track and switching approaches mid-project. The requirement that orchestrators auto-reject steps without context updates is brilliant.

**TDD Integration**: It takes your TDD guide and makes it operational within your existing system rather than replacing it. The "failing test run logs as proof" requirement prevents agents from cheating the process.

**Validation Gates**: The "key delivery" pause-points solve your worry about agents taking shortcuts. They can't proceed without explicit approval, and the delivery packet format ensures thorough review.

## Particularly Smart Elements

1. **Consistency Guard**: The YAML spec preventing introduction of alternative tools (like adding `requests` when `httpx` is standard) directly prevents the "both practices are valid but not when merged" problem you identified.

2. **Pre-commit Automation**: Moving quality checks to pre-commit hooks makes them unavoidable rather than optional.

3. **Concrete Artifacts**: The PR template and commit message format create paper trails that make deviations visible.

4. **Definition of Done**: Clear, measurable criteria that can be automated.

## Minor Considerations

- The coverage threshold (85%) might need project-specific tuning
- The "key deliveries" list in the YAML should be customized to your specific application architecture
- You'll want to define your specific "forbidden patterns" beyond the examples given

## Bottom Line

This framework directly addresses every concern you raised:
- ✅ Prevents shortcuts and hardcoded solutions
- ✅ Maintains consistency across sessions
- ✅ Enforces validation before proceeding
- ✅ Integrates TDD with your existing tools
- ✅ Creates context continuity

It's ready to implement as-is. The guardrails are concrete enough to be enforceable but flexible enough to adapt to your specific tech stack. This transforms your development process from "hoping agents do the right thing" to "making it impossible for them to do the wrong thing."
