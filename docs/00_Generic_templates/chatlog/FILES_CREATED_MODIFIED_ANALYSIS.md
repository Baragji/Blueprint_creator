# Files Created/Modified Analysis from Chatlog

Based on the conversation in `01_having_gpt_produce_generic.md`, here are the files that were created or modified:

## Files Actually Modified (According to AI Claims)

### 1. MC Coordinator Template
**File**: `docs/02_Execution_framework/02_templates_prompt_workflows/02_workflow_templates/Generic_version/01_mc-coordinator.md`
- **Version**: Bumped to 2.0
- **Purpose**: Main orchestration agent template, made generic and cross-project compatible
- **Changes**: Removed repo-specific paths, added auto-detection, standardized portable directory structure

### 2. Task Executor Template
**File**: `docs/02_Execution_framework/02_templates_prompt_workflows/02_workflow_templates/Generic_version/02_task-executor.md`
- **Version**: Bumped to 2.0
- **Purpose**: Implementation agent that executes micro-tasks from MC briefs
- **Changes**: Made generic, removed Phase-0-only assumptions, added seeded-failure/red then passing/green evidence workflow

### 3. Zero Trust Validator Template
**File**: `docs/02_Execution_framework/02_templates_prompt_workflows/02_workflow_templates/Generic_version/03_zero-trust-validator.md`
- **Version**: Bumped to 2.0
- **Purpose**: Validation agent that verifies executor outputs with ACCEPT/REJECT decisions
- **Changes**: Generic validation framework, maintained MC → Executor → Validator handshake flow

## Files Promised but Never Created (AI Failure)

### 4. Planner Template
**File**: `docs/02_Execution_framework/02_templates_prompt_workflows/02_workflow_templates/Generic_version/00_planner.md`
- **Status**: AI claimed it would create this but never did (conversation ended abruptly)
- **Purpose**: Strategic planning agent to generate plan.json roadmaps for MC consumption
- **Intended Role**: Bridge between user goals and actionable MC task decomposition

## Canonical Directory Structure (Mentioned but Not Created)

The AI discussed creating these directories for any project using the framework:

```
docs/execution/
├── briefs/              # MC-generated task briefs for Executor
├── reports/
│   ├── executor/        # Executor completion reports
│   └── validator/       # Validator ACCEPT/REJECT reports
├── state/               # State management files
│   ├── CURRENT_STATE.md
│   ├── EVIDENCE_LOG.md
│   └── SESSION_HANDOFF.md
├── evidence/            # Validation artifacts and test outputs
└── plan.json           # Planner-generated actionable roadmap
```

### State Files Purpose:
- **CURRENT_STATE.md**: Current project status, blockers, next actions
- **EVIDENCE_LOG.md**: Accumulates validation evidence from all tasks
- **SESSION_HANDOFF.md**: Inter-session communication and context preservation
- **plan.json**: Structured roadmap with phases, tasks, dependencies, acceptance criteria

## Bootstrap Process (Defined but Not Implemented)

**Purpose**: Automatic first-time setup when MC detects uninitialized repository
**Function**: Creates canonical directories and seeds state files with minimal content
**Trigger**: MC detects missing execution framework infrastructure

## Adaptive Mode Selection Policy (Defined)

**Purpose**: Allow MC to automatically choose appropriate operational mode based on project complexity
**Modes**:
- **MC-only**: Simple, single-task projects
- **MC+Planner**: Balanced approach for most projects (recommended default)
- **Full multi-agent**: Enterprise/complex projects with additional roles

**Decision Factors**:
- Repository state (empty, simple, complex, monorepo)
- User intent ("build product" vs "fix small issue")
- Existing artifacts (plan.json present/absent)

## Summary

**Actually Modified**: 3 core agent templates (MC, Executor, Validator) to be generic and cross-project
**Promised but Missing**: 1 Planner template (AI conversation ended before delivery)
**Framework Defined**: Canonical directory structure, state management, bootstrap process, adaptive mode selection

The conversation successfully genericized the core MC → Executor → Validator workflow but left the Planner component incomplete, requiring manual creation to complete the "MC+Planner" operational mode.
