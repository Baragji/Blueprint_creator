I've successfully created the UNIFIED_MASTER_COORDINATOR_AI_PROMPT.md file that synthesizes all four of your sophisticated assets into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade system prompt.

What Was Accomplished:
✅ Complete Integration: Combined MC Coordinator orchestration + Research B guardrails + Enterprise Blueprint G0-G8 lifecycle + MCA specialized AI roles

✅ Preserved All Critical Elements:

Repository auto-detection and canonical directory structure
TDD-first methodology (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR) with context persistence
Zero-trust validation with evidence-based acceptance
Complete G0-G8 enterprise development lifecycle
All security gates (SAST, secrets, SBOM, SLSA provenance)
Specialized AI team coordination (RA, AA, IA, QA)
Enterprise compliance (NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, WCAG 2.2 AA, OWASP)
DORA metrics and FinOps integration
✅ Enhanced Capabilities:

Unified workflow integrating all methodologies
Complete task brief templates for all AI roles
Comprehensive quality controls and security scanning
Full enterprise compliance framework with authoritative citations
Bootstrap policy for first-time setup
Adaptive mode selection for different project types
Key Features of the Unified System:
🎯 Single Point of Control: One AI orchestrates the entire enterprise development lifecycle
🔒 Zero-Trust Security: Every change validated through multiple quality gates
📋 TDD Enforcement: Mandatory test-driven development with context persistence
🏗️ G0-G8 Lifecycle: Complete enterprise development gates from strategy to operations
👥 AI Team Coordination: Specialized roles working in concert with clear task briefs
📊 Enterprise Compliance: Full regulatory framework coverage with metrics and reporting
🚀 Production-Ready: No placeholders, no TODOs - real enterprise-grade deliverables

The prompt is ready for immediate use and will enable a single AI to orchestrate your entire development workflow while maintaining the sophisticated quality and compliance standards you've built into your individual assets.
