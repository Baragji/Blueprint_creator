## 🚀 QUICK START

### Option 1: Initialize Full Enterprise Workflow
```bash
# For new projects or comprehensive transformation
"Initialize enterprise workflow for Blueprint_creator"
```
**Result**: UMCA will auto-detect repository, create structure, begin G0 Strategy & Risk Scoping

### Option 2: Execute Single Task
```bash
# For specific, scoped changes
"Quick task: implement user authentication endpoint with TDD"
```
**Result**: UMCA will execute atomic task with full quality gates

### Option 3: Resume from Plan  
```bash
# Continue existing work
"Resume from plan.json"
```
**Result**: UMCA reads existing plan and continues from next dependency-ready task

## 🎮 HOW TO USE THE MASTER COORDINATOR

### 1. **Start a Session**
Copy the **entire** contents of `UNIFIED_MASTER_COORDINATOR_AI_PROMPT.md` and paste it as a system prompt to your AI assistant.

### 2. **Issue Commands**
The Master Coordinator understands natural language and will translate your requests into formal task briefs for specialized AI assistants.

**Examples**:
```bash
# Strategic level
"Begin G0 strategy phase for this AI-first platform"

# Tactical level  
"Create authentication API with JWT tokens using TDD"

# Operational level
"Run security scans and generate compliance report"
```

### 3. **Monitor Progress**
Check these files for real-time status:
- `docs/execution/state/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Current project status
- `docs/execution/state/GATES_LEDGER.md` - G0-G8 gate progress
- `docs/execution/evidence/` - All quality evidence and artifacts

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES

### Specialized AI Team Coordination
The system coordinates 4 specialized assistants:

1. **Research Assistant (RA)**: Technology research, options analysis, authoritative recommendations
2. **Architect Assistant (AA)**: Technical design, system architecture, specifications
3. **Implementation Assistant (IA)**: TDD code development, integration work
4. **QA Assistant (QA)**: Testing, security scanning, compliance verification

### Quality Gates (All Automated)
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: ≥85% required, automatically enforced
- ✅ **Security Scanning**: SAST (Semgrep), secrets (Gitleaks), dependencies
- ✅ **Supply Chain Security**: SBOM generation, OpenSSF Scorecard, Cosign signing
- ✅ **Compliance**: NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, OWASP ASVS, WCAG 2.2 AA
- ✅ **Build Provenance**: SLSA attestations for all artifacts

### Enterprise Features
- **G0-G8 Lifecycle**: Complete enterprise development gates
- **DORA Metrics**: Automated tracking of deployment frequency, lead time, etc.
- **FinOps**: Cost tracking with FOCUS standard compliance
- **OpenTelemetry**: Built-in observability instrumentation
- **Zero-Trust Validation**: Every deliverable independently verified

---

## 📊 MONITORING & METRICS

### Real-time Dashboards
The system generates JSON data for dashboard consumption:
- **DORA Metrics**: `docs/execution/evidence/dora.json`
- **Cost Data**: `docs/execution/evidence/focus.json`
- **Security Posture**: Evidence files in `docs/execution/evidence/`

### Quality Evidence
Every task completion generates:
- Test results and coverage reports
- Security scan outputs (SAST, secrets, dependencies)  
- SBOM files and provenance attestations
- Screenshots/demos of functionality
- Compliance verification results

---

## 🛡️ SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### Automated Security Scanning
- **SAST**: Semgrep with OWASP rulesets
- **Secrets**: Gitleaks with comprehensive pattern detection
- **Dependencies**: npm audit + Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Supply Chain**: OpenSSF Scorecard + Cosign signing

### Compliance Frameworks  
- **NIST AI RMF 1.0**: AI risk management framework
- **ISO/IEC 42001**: AI management system requirements
- **OWASP ASVS**: Application security verification standard
- **OWASP LLM Top-10**: AI/LLM specific security risks
- **WCAG 2.2 AA**: Web accessibility compliance

### Evidence-Based Validation
- All quality gates require verifiable evidence
- Independent QA validation for all deliverables  
- Complete audit trail in `EVIDENCE_LOG.md`
- Human approval required at critical gates (G0, G1, G2, G6)

## 🔄 WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

### Example 1: New Feature Development
```bash
1. "Research best practices for OAuth 2.0 implementation"
   → RA provides options analysis with authoritative citations

2. "Design secure OAuth 2.0 API architecture"  
   → AA creates detailed API contracts and security model

3. "Implement OAuth login endpoint using TDD"
   → IA develops with RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle

4. "Validate OAuth implementation meets security standards"
   → QA runs tests, security scans, generates evidence package
```

### Example 2: Compliance Assessment
```bash
1. "Assess NIST AI RMF applicability for our AI features"
   → RA researches requirements and creates compliance matrix

2. "Design AI governance architecture per NIST guidelines"
   → AA creates governance framework and risk controls

3. "Generate compliance evidence package"
   → QA collects all documentation and creates audit package
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### ✅ Must-Have Practices
- **TDD Mandatory**: Every code change follows RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- **Evidence Required**: No progression without verifiable artifacts
- **Security First**: All gates must pass before merge/deployment
- **Human Oversight**: Critical gates require human approval
- **Incremental Delivery**: Working software each iteration

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Skipping Tests**: System will reject any PR without adequate coverage
- **Manual Quality Checks**: All scanning must be automated and passing
- **Missing Documentation**: Every change requires docs updates
- **Gate Bypassing**: G0-G8 gates must be completed in sequence
