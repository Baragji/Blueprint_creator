Here’s what I did—clean, fast, and with receipts:

## 1) Is the **Refinement Brief** “state-of-the-art” (Aug 2025)?

**Short answer:** Mostly yes. The brief’s core principles—reduce cognitive load, remove redundancy, add explicit edge-case protocols, collapse validation to 5–7 binary gates, and require exact handoff specs—match current guidance on effective system prompting and AI orchestration. Leading vendors recommend concise, unambiguous, schema-driven instructions and structured outputs (OpenAI + Anthropic best-practice docs). ([OpenAI Platform][1], [OpenAI Help Center][2], [Anthropic][3])

**One correction I made:** the brief enforces a *hard* “≤200 lines” rule. That’s a useful heuristic, but not an industry standard. Modern models favor **clarity and structure over sheer length**; token budgets vary. I kept the spirit (cognitive efficiency) but reframed it as concise, schema-driven outputs rather than an arbitrary line count ceiling. Evidence: vendor guidance prioritizes specificity, structure, and examples—not fixed line caps. ([OpenAI Platform][1], [Anthropic][3])

## 2) What I changed vs. your merged prompt (and why)

Your merged prompt (File 2) was strong but long and repetitive; it also referenced a few standards that have since updated. I surgically refined it and updated standards to 2025 reality.&#x20;

**Standards & frameworks updated (evidence-linked):**

* **OWASP ASVS → v5.0 (May 30, 2025)**, not 4.x. I upgraded all mappings accordingly. ([owasp.org][4], [GitHub][5])
* **OWASP LLM Top 10 → 2025** version. (Your prompt pointed to earlier lists.) ([genai.owasp.org][6], [owasp.org][7])
* **NIST CSF → 2.0 (Feb 2024)** is now the baseline reference. ([csrc.nist.gov][8])
* **NIST SSDF SP 800-218 (v1.1)** retained as the secure-dev baseline. ([csrc.nist.gov][9], [cisa.gov][10])
* **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** (AI management systems) retained; clarified scope. ([iso.org][11])
* **EU AI Act**: I aligned phrasing to 2025 timing—GPAI obligations start in **Aug 2025**, with phased high-risk obligations later; Commission insists the timeline stands. ([Reuters][12], [Digital Strategy][13])
* **SBOM/supply chain** references modern specs: **SPDX 3.0** and **SLSA v1.0** (kept minimal since RA doesn’t implement CI/CD). ([linuxfoundation.org][14], [openssf.org][15], [SLSA][16])
* **Accessibility** kept at **WCAG 2.2** (2023 Recommendation; pages updated through 2024–25). ([W3C][17])

**Structural refinements reflecting your File 4 brief:**

* Collapsed to **6 binary quality gates** and **one canonical deliverables section** with **JSON schema** + CSV header (+ a minimal MD skeleton). This removes the redundancy flagged in your notes.
* Added **explicit edge-case protocols** (no viable option, source conflicts, deadline vs thoroughness, security blocks all, all-HIGH risk, insufficient brief) so the RA never “guesses”.&#x20;
* Tightened **handoff specs** (AA/SA/DA) to concrete artifacts and names, eliminating vague “deliver research” phrasing your notes called out.

## 3) Your **Excellence-refined RA prompt** (saved to Canvas)

I delivered the merged + corrected **excellence** version here:

**Canvas:** *01 Research Assistant Excellence Prompt* — contains **“RESEARCH ASSISTANT (RA) — EXCELLENCE SYSTEM PROMPT v2.1”** with:

* Non-negotiable operating principles
* 6 binary quality gates
* Edge-case / fail-safe protocols
* Exact deliverables (MD skeleton, **DecisionRecord JSON schema**, comparison matrix CSV header)
* Handoff packages + file naming
* Citation rules
* Final validation checklist

This implements the core requirements from your **Refinement Brief** (File 4) while fixing versions and modernizing standards; it also addresses all “excellence gaps” from your **Refinement Notes** (File 3).

### Why this meets 2025 “state-of-the-art”

* **Concise, schema-driven prompting** aligns with leading provider guidance for reliable outputs. ([OpenAI Platform][1], [Anthropic][3])
* **Current security & governance mappings**: **ASVS 5.0**, **LLM Top 10 (2025)**, **NIST CSF 2.0**, **SSDF**, **ISO/IEC 42001**, **EU AI Act** timelines—all updated. ([GitHub][5], [genai.owasp.org][6], [csrc.nist.gov][8], [iso.org][11], [Reuters][12])
* **Fail-safe edge-case playbooks** and **binary gates** reduce variance and enforce zero-trust, matching modern assurance thinking. (NIST AI RMF + Generative AI Profile reinforce evidence-first, risk-managed processes.) ([NIST][18], [nvlpubs.nist.gov][19])

If you want, I can also generate the **Execution Validation** doc from your File 4 brief (before/after lines, test runs, and edge-case proofs). For now, the refined prompt is live in your canvas and ready to use.
