# MERGE TASK BRIEF - Research Assistant Specialized Prompt

**Task Type**: Prompt Integration and Enhancement  
**Priority**: Critical - Required for UMCA Test #2  
**Objective**: Create comprehensive Research Assistant prompt combining UMCA framework integration with expert-level domain knowledge  

---

## TASK OVERVIEW

### What Needs to Be Done
Merge two complementary Research Assistant prompts into a single, comprehensive system prompt that enables both:
1. **UMCA Framework Compliance** (coordination protocols, quality gates, handoff procedures)
2. **Expert-Level Deliverables** (production-ready research templates, industry expertise)

### Why This Matters
Our UMCA system evaluation identified that single-purpose AIs lack the specialization needed to prevent critical development pitfalls. We need AIs that can both:
- Work within the UMCA coordination framework
- Produce professional-grade deliverables using industry best practices

## SUCCESS DEFINITION

### Primary Objective Met When:
The merged prompt enables the Research Assistant AI to:
1. **Operate within UMCA framework** (proper handoffs, quality gates, evidence requirements)
2. **Produce expert-level research deliverables** (authoritative sources, comprehensive analysis, industry standards)
3. **Maintain quality standards** (measurable criteria, validation requirements, professional templates)
4. **Coordinate effectively** (clear boundaries, escalation procedures, structured outputs)

### Expected Outcome:
A Research Assistant AI that can prevent development pitfalls through:
- Professional-grade technology research and recommendations
- Proper integration with other specialized AI roles
- Evidence-based decision making with authoritative citations
- Quality-gated progression preventing over-promising and under-delivering

## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

### Why This Merge is Critical
Our UMCA evaluation identified that 11 of 19 AI development pitfalls were present in our prototype, largely due to lack of true AI specialization. The Research Assistant is the foundation of the entire system - poor research leads to cascading failures in architecture, implementation, and quality.

### Expected Impact
A properly merged Research Assistant prompt should address these specific pitfalls:
- **#7 Over-promising, under-delivering**: Evidence-based recommendations with proper validation
- **#13 Context loss**: Clear handoff protocols maintain requirements integrity  
- **#15 Best practice violations**: Industry standards enforcement from authoritative sources
- **#17 Reinvents the wheel**: Research-backed recommendations for mature solutions
