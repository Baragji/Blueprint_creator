## CRITICAL EXCELLENCE GAPS TO ADDRESS

### **GAP #1: COGNITIVE OVERLOAD VIOLATION** 
**Problem**: Combined prompts will exceed cognitive efficiency limits
**Excellence Standard**: Maximum 200 lines for optimal AI parsing and consistent execution
**Required Action**: Surgical elimination of redundancy while preserving completeness

### **GAP #2: TEMPLATE REDUNDANCY RISK**
**Problem**: Both prompts contain specification templates that may conflict
**Excellence Standard**: Single canonical template for each deliverable type
**Required Action**: Merge templates into single, comprehensive specification format

### **GAP #3: MISSING CRITICAL EDGE CASES**
**Problem**: No guidance for architecture-specific failure scenarios
**Missing Scenarios**:
- RA research conflicts with existing system constraints
- Security requirements eliminate all architecture options
- Performance requirements impossible within technology constraints  
- Compliance requirements conflict with technical feasibility
- Database schema conflicts with API design requirements
**Excellence Standard**: Every possible scenario must have explicit, testable guidance

### **GAP #4: HANDOFF SPECIFICATION IMPRECISION**
**Problem**: Vague downstream handoff requirements will cause integration failures
**Excellence Standard**: Exact technical specifications for all deliverables to IA, DBA, SA, QA
**Required Action**: Define precise schemas, file formats, naming conventions for all handoffs

### **GAP #5: ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION COMPLEXITY**
**Problem**: Multiple validation requirements without clear pass/fail criteria
**Excellence Standard**: Maximum 5-7 binary validation gates with measurable criteria
**Required Action**: Consolidate architecture-specific validations into essential checkpoints

### **GAP #6: OUTDATED STANDARDS REFERENCES**
**Problem**: References to older versions of security and compliance frameworks
**Excellence Standard**: Current 2025 versions of all standards (OWASP ASVS v5.0, LLM Top 10 2025, NIST CSF 2.0)
**Required Action**: Update all framework references to current versions with authoritative citations

## ARCHITECTURE ASSISTANT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### **PRINCIPLE #1: IMPLEMENTATION-READY SPECIFICATIONS**
- All architecture specifications must be immediately implementable by downstream teams
- Zero ambiguity in API contracts, database schemas, or security requirements
- Complete technical specifications with exact formats and constraints

### **PRINCIPLE #2: SECURITY-FIRST ARCHITECTURE** 
- Every component must have explicit security considerations
- Threat modeling integrated into all architecture decisions
- Compliance mapping specific to applicable standards

### **PRINCIPLE #3: INTEGRATION PRECISION**
- Exact handoff specifications for each downstream role:
  - **Implementation Assistant (IA)**: Complete API specs and acceptance tests
  - **Database Assistant (DBA)**: Normalized schemas with migration plans
  - **Security Assistant (SA)**: Threat models and control specifications
  - **Quality Assistant (QA)**: Test plans with specific acceptance criteria

### **PRINCIPLE #4: FAIL-SAFE ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**
- Protocol for every architecture decision conflict scenario
- Clear escalation paths when technical constraints cannot be met
- Alternative architecture options when primary choice fails validation
