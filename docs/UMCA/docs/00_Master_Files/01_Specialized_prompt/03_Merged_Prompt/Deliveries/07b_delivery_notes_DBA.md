On it—DBA round, same surgical rigor.

# 1) Does the refinement brief reflect Aug-2025 best practice?

**Verdict: yes, with a few precise modernizations I applied.** The brief’s constraints (≤200 lines, single canonical template, 5–7 binary gates, automation-first, explicit handoffs) are sound. I updated anchors to today’s state of the art:

* **PostgreSQL baseline → 17.x.** PG-17 is current stable; adds logical-replication failover control and `pg_createsubscriber`, with minor 17.5 on 2025-05-08 and regular minor drops (next: 2025-08-14). ([PostgreSQL][1], [AWS Dokumentation][2])
* **Pooling → PgBouncer 1.24+.** Prepared-statement support is on by default; 1.24.1 fixes a 2025 CVE. ([pgbouncer.org][3], [GitHub][4])
* **Backups/DR → pgBackRest & WAL-G.** pgBackRest 2.56 is current; WAL-G 3.0 and docs remain the standard for encrypted, compressed, remote backups. ([pgbackrest.org][5], [PostgreSQL][6], [wal-g.readthedocs.io][7])
* **Kubernetes → CloudNativePG operator.** Now a CNCF project (2025), with recent 1.25/1.26 releases; good north-star for managed PG on K8s. ([cncf.io][8], [cloudnative-pg.io][9])
* **Observability → query + I/O telemetry.** Use `compute_query_id` + `pg_stat_statements` and `pg_stat_io` (PG-16+) and standard Postgres exporter for Prometheus; capture slow plans via `auto_explain`. ([PostgreSQL][10], [GitHub][11])

Everything else in the brief aligns; I pruned any legacy references and folded these updates into the merged prompt.

# 2) Sources merged (your files)

* **System prompt (DBA):** used as backbone.&#x20;
* **Expert DBA prompt:** mined for domain templates (migrations, RLS, perf).&#x20;
* **Refinement brief (DBA):** followed as the controlling spec.&#x20;

# 3) Deviations I made & evidence

* **Pin baseline to Postgres 17.x** (not “16+”): better HA via logical-replication failover control, `pg_createsubscriber`, updated vacuum/checkpointer stats. ([PostgreSQL][1], [pganalyze][12])
* **Make pooling mandatory with 1.24+** to leverage prepared-statement defaults and 2025 security fixes. ([pgbouncer.org][3], [GitHub][4])
* **Codify restore rehearsals** as a **gate**, using pgBackRest/WAL-G with PITR evidence. ([pgbackrest.org][5], [wal-g.readthedocs.io][7])
* **Require query/I-O telemetry** (`pg_stat_statements`, `compute_query_id`, `pg_stat_io`) and a Prometheus exporter endpoint as evidence. ([PostgreSQL][10], [GitHub][11])
* **K8s operator guidance** updated to CloudNativePG (CNCF). ([cncf.io][8], [cloudnative-pg.io][9])

# 4) Your merged **Database Assistant — Excellence System Prompt**

I’ve created and saved the merged, ≤200-line **DBA** prompt to canvas:

**▶ 03 Database Assistant — Excellence System Prompt**

It contains:

* **7 binary gates** (inputs, migrations/data-safety, perf/indexing+pooling, security/RLS, HA/DR with restore rehearsal, observability, repo hygiene).
* A **single canonical deliverable template** (spec → migrations → perf → security → HA/DR → observability → evidence + package JSON).
* **Edge-case protocols** for rollback-impossible, version conflicts, capacity/tenancy, HA break, backup failures.
* **Modern baselines (Aug-2025)**: PG-17.x, PgBouncer 1.24+, pgBackRest/WAL-G, CloudNativePG, `pg_stat_*` + exporter.

If you want, I can also produce a compact **execution-validation note** (before/after line count, gate-by-gate mapping to sources) as a second canvas doc.

**(For traceability)** Original inputs I merged came from your uploaded system & expert prompts and the refinement brief.
