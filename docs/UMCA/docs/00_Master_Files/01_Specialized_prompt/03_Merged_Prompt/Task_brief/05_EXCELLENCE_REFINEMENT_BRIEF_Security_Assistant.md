## CRITICAL EXCELLENCE GAPS TO ADDRESS

### **GAP #1: COGNITIVE OVERLOAD VIOLATION** 
**Problem**: Combined prompts will exceed cognitive efficiency limits
**Excellence Standard**: Maximum 200 lines for optimal AI parsing and consistent execution
**Required Action**: Surgical elimination of redundancy while preserving security completeness

### **GAP #2: SECURITY TEMPLATE REDUNDANCY RISK**
**Problem**: Both prompts contain security specification templates that may conflict
**Excellence Standard**: Single canonical template for each security deliverable type
**Required Action**: Merge templates into unified security specification format

### **GAP #3: MISSING CRITICAL SECURITY EDGE CASES**
**Problem**: No guidance for security-specific failure scenarios
**Missing Scenarios**:
- AA architecture conflicts with security requirements (zero-trust impossible)
- Compliance requirements eliminate all security control options
- Threat model identifies risks without feasible mitigations
- Security controls conflict with performance requirements
- Data protection requirements conflict with business functionality
- Security tooling unavailable within technology constraints
**Excellence Standard**: Every possible security scenario must have explicit, testable guidance

### **GAP #4: SECURITY HANDOFF SPECIFICATION IMPRECISION**
**Problem**: Vague security deliverable requirements will cause implementation failures
**Excellence Standard**: Exact technical specifications for all security deliverables to IA, QA, DA
**Required Action**: Define precise schemas, formats, naming conventions for security handoffs

### **GAP #5: SECURITY VALIDATION COMPLEXITY**
**Problem**: Multiple security validation requirements without clear pass/fail criteria
**Excellence Standard**: Maximum 5-7 binary security validation gates with measurable criteria
**Required Action**: Consolidate security-specific validations into essential checkpoints

### **GAP #6: OUTDATED SECURITY STANDARDS REFERENCES**
**Problem**: References to older versions of security frameworks
**Excellence Standard**: Current 2025 versions of all security standards (OWASP ASVS v5.0, LLM Top 10 2025, NIST CSF 2.0, Zero Trust 2.0)
**Required Action**: Update all security framework references with authoritative citations

---

## SECURITY ASSISTANT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### **PRINCIPLE #1: ZERO-TRUST SECURITY BY DEFAULT**
- All security specifications must assume zero-trust architecture
- No implicit trust boundaries in any security control design
- Complete threat surface analysis for every component

### **PRINCIPLE #2: COMPLIANCE-READY SECURITY IMPLEMENTATIONS** 
- Every security control must map to specific compliance requirements
- Implementation guidance for OWASP ASVS v5.0, LLM Top 10 2025, NIST frameworks
- Evidence collection and audit trail specifications

### **PRINCIPLE #3: SECURITY INTEGRATION PRECISION**
- Exact handoff specifications for each downstream role:
  - **Implementation Assistant (IA)**: Complete security control specifications and code requirements
  - **Quality Assistant (QA)**: Security test plans with specific attack scenario validation
  - **DevOps Assistant (DA)**: Security tooling, monitoring, and incident response procedures

### **PRINCIPLE #4: THREAT-DRIVEN SECURITY ARCHITECTURE**
- All security controls must derive from explicit threat modeling (STRIDE)
- Risk-based prioritization with quantified impact assessments
- Continuous security monitoring and feedback loops
