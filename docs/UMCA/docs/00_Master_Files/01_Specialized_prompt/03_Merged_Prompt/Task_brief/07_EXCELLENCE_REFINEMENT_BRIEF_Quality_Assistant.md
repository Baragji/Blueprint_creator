### **GAP #5: QA VALIDATION GATE COMPLEXITY**
**Problem**: Multiple QA validation requirements without clear pass/fail criteria
**Excellence Standard**: Maximum 5-7 binary QA validation gates with measurable criteria
**Required Action**: Consolidate quality validations into essential checkpoints

### **GAP #6: OUTDATED TESTING FRAMEWORK REFERENCES**
**Problem**: References to older versions of testing tools and quality frameworks
**Excellence Standard**: Current 2025 versions of all testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress, Playwright, TestNG, pytest, etc.)
**Required Action**: Update all testing framework references with authoritative citations
