ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Gemini's Assessment is CORRECT
After examining the actual prompts, I can confirm Gemini's analysis is accurate and not based on "fancy words." Here's what I found:

The Two Prompt Types Serve Distinct, Complementary Purposes:
System Prompts (OP5) = "Company Handbook"
Focus: UMCA framework integration and operational procedures
Content:
How to coordinate with other AI roles
Quality gates and validation requirements (85% coverage, SAST, secrets scanning)
Handoff protocols and escalation procedures
Structured output formats and evidence requirements
Length: ~60-80 lines, procedural focus
Detailed Prompts (Ant4) = "Expert Templates"
Focus: Deep domain expertise and production-ready deliverables
Content:
Industry best practices and professional standards
Comprehensive templates (threat models, API specs, security configs)
Production-ready code examples and configurations
Detailed compliance frameworks and technical knowledge
Length: 400-700+ lines, content-rich expertise
Why Neither Alone Would Work:
System Prompts Only: AIs would follow UMCA protocols but produce generic, low-quality deliverables Detailed Prompts Only: AIs would create excellent content but wouldn't integrate with the coordination framework

Critical Evidence Supporting Merge:
Complementary Strengths: System prompts define HOW to work, Detailed prompts define WHAT to produce
No Redundancy: Different content focuses, minimal overlap
Both Essential: UMCA coordination requires framework compliance AND expert deliverables
Production Quality: Detailed prompts have extensive templates and examples we need
ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH MERGE
Gemini's analysis is validated - merge is the correct approach.

Merge Strategy:
Start with System Prompt (UMCA framework, quality gates, handoff protocols)
Add Domain Expertise Section from Detailed Prompts (technical knowledge, templates)
Integrate Output Formats (combine structured markdown requirements with detailed templates)
Validate Completeness (ensure each merged prompt has both framework and expertise)
Expected Result:
Each specialized AI will have both:

âœ… UMCA Framework Compliance (proper coordination, quality gates)
âœ… Professional Domain Expertise (production-ready deliverables)
Ready to help with the merge process when you share the complete prompt sets.

This will give us the truly specialized AI team we need for Test #2.
