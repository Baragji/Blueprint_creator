## 🎯 **Test Components & Success Criteria**

### **1. Master Coordinator Prompt Testing**
**What We're Testing**: Does the prompt actually work with real AI assistants?

#### Test Cases:
```markdown
TC1: Prompt Parsing
- Give the full prompt to an AI assistant
- SUCCESS: AI accepts prompt without errors/confusion
- SUCCESS: AI acknowledges its role as Master Coordinator

TC2: Basic Task Generation  
- Request: "Quick task: add a simple function with tests"
- SUCCESS: AI generates proper task brief with IA assignment
- SUCCESS: Task brief includes TDD methodology

TC3: G0 Phase Initiation
- Request: "Initialize enterprise workflow for test project" 
- SUCCESS: AI begins G0 Strategy & Risk Scoping
- SUCCESS: AI creates or references appropriate state files

TC4: Specialized AI Coordination
- Request: "Research authentication options for Node.js"
- SUCCESS: AI generates RA (Research Assistant) task brief
- SUCCESS: Task brief follows the specified template format
```

### **2. CI/CD Pipeline Testing**
**What We're Testing**: Does the GitHub Actions workflow execute successfully?

#### Test Cases:
```markdown
TC5: Pipeline Trigger
- Push code to main branch
- SUCCESS: Workflow triggers automatically
- SUCCESS: All jobs start without configuration errors

TC6: Test Execution & Coverage
- Include tests with varying coverage levels
- SUCCESS: Tests execute and generate coverage report
- SUCCESS: Coverage script correctly enforces ≥85% threshold

TC7: Security Scanning
- Include clean code (should pass)
- Include code with intentional issues (should fail)
- SUCCESS: Semgrep SAST scan executes
- SUCCESS: Gitleaks secret scan executes  
- SUCCESS: Pipeline fails appropriately on security issues

TC8: SBOM & Provenance
- Build with dependencies
- SUCCESS: CycloneDX SBOM generates correctly
- SUCCESS: Build provenance attestation created
- SUCCESS: Artifacts uploaded to expected locations
```

### **3. Helper Scripts Testing**
**What We're Testing**: Do the automation scripts work correctly?

#### Test Cases:
```markdown
TC9: Coverage Enforcement Script
- Run with coverage above threshold (85%)
- SUCCESS: Script passes and creates evidence file
- Run with coverage below threshold  
- SUCCESS: Script fails with specific feedback

TC10: Context Update Script
- Execute: python3 scripts/update_context.py "test update"
- SUCCESS: CURRENT_STATE.md gets updated with timestamp
- SUCCESS: EVIDENCE_LOG.md gets updated with entry
- SUCCESS: Context snapshot JSON file created
```

### **4. State Management Testing**
**What We're Testing**: Do the state files work as intended?

#### Test Cases:
```markdown
TC11: State File Structure
- Copy state templates to docs/execution/state/
- SUCCESS: All files have proper structure and content
- SUCCESS: Files are readable and well-formatted

TC12: State File Updates
- Run context update script multiple times
- SUCCESS: Files update correctly without corruption
- SUCCESS: Timestamps and entries accumulate properly
```

### **5. Integration Testing**
**What We're Testing**: Does the whole system work together?

#### Test Cases:
```markdown
TC13: End-to-End Workflow
- Start with Master Coordinator prompt
- Request simple feature development
- Execute through CI pipeline  
- SUCCESS: Complete workflow from AI task to deployed artifact
- SUCCESS: All quality gates enforced
- SUCCESS: Evidence collected throughout

TC14: Multi-Session Continuity
- Start session with Master Coordinator
- Update context and state files
- Begin new session referencing state files
- SUCCESS: New session can continue from where previous left off
```
