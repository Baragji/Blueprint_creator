Yes, it's very clear what you want! From reading your conversation log, I can see you're looking to:

Create a comprehensive research brief for your research AI to compile software engineering best practices
Have that AI generate a structured manual/workbook (potentially up to 50 pages) covering best practices across different contexts
Review and refine the results together after your research AI completes the work

You want the research to cover best practices that vary by:

Programming language (Python vs TypeScript, etc.)
Project scale (small vs large)
Application type (frontend vs backend)
Industry standards for when to choose different languages/approaches

The goal is to create a "business context package" that removes the vagueness from telling AIs to "follow best practices" by giving them concrete, specific rules they can follow.
You also discovered the concept of modular knowledge storage (like RAG systems) where individual specialist AIs can reference external knowledge bases rather than having everything crammed into their system prompts.
Should I create that research brief for your research AI now? I can structure it to guide them toward creating a comprehensive, well-organized best practices manual that covers all the areas you mentioned.RetryYyes please. remember to do august 2025 reserach yourself first, before you create the reserach brief, as this week a new eu act and regulation has been passed.

Based on my research, I can see that August 2, 2025 (which was just passed this week) was a major milestone for the EU AI Act implementation. Here's what became effective:
Key developments that just happened (August 2, 2025):

GPAI models (General Purpose AI) compliance requirements are now in effect
Governance structures, including penalties and fines (up to â‚¬35M or 7% of global turnover), are now active
Member States must now have designated national competent authorities

Software Engineering Best Practices Research Brief - August 2025DocumentÂ # Software Engineering Best Practices Research Brief
**Date:** August 2025  
**For:** Research AI  
**Objective:** Compile a comprehensive manual/workbook on software engineering best practices

## Research Mission
Create a structured manual that remI've created a comprehensive research brief that incorporates the critical EU AI Act developments that just went into effect on August 2, 2025. The brief is structured to guide your research AI toward creating a thorough, compliant, and practical best practices manual.
Key highlights of the research brief:
ðŸš¨ EU AI Act Priority: I've made compliance with the newly effective EU AI Act requirements a top priority, including:

GPAI model compliance requirements
Documentation and transparency obligations
Risk assessment frameworks
Penalty structures (up to â‚¬35M fines)

Comprehensive Coverage: The brief covers 10 major areas from universal practices to AI-specific requirements, ensuring your research AI will create a thorough manual that addresses all aspects of modern software development.
Actionable Structure: I've specified that every recommendation must be concrete and implementable, moving away from vague "best practice" terminology toward specific, measurable guidelines.
Modular Design: The manual will be structured so different sections can be referenced independently - perfect for your RAG system approach where different specialist AIs can pull relevant knowledge as needed.
The research brief should guide your research AI to create approximately 50+ pages of structured content that will serve as your "business context package" for removing ambiguity from AI development workflows. Once your research AI completes this, we can review and refine the results together.Retry08_master_coordinator_assistant_excellence_system_prompt.md152 linesmdYim actually creating this system. (this is the system prompt for the MC), and i have 7 other prompt for the 7 specialized ai's. the idea is to hand the mc a complete manual/workbook he can reference when deciding / creating a task brief / software etc. and either have all other ai's have access to the same workbook, for reference (or maybe creating 8 distinct best-practice workbooks/manual for each specialiazion. what do you think? what would function best?EditLooking at your Master Coordinator system prompt, I can see this is a sophisticated multi-AI orchestration system. For the best practices manual/workbook distribution, I'd recommend a hybrid approach that balances efficiency with specialization:
Recommended Approach: One Core + Seven Specialized Supplements
1. Single Comprehensive Core Manual (for MC + all AIs)

Contains all the universal best practices (your research AI's full output)
EU AI Act compliance requirements
Cross-domain decision frameworks
Common standards and protocols
This becomes your "business context package" that all AIs reference

2. Seven Specialized Practice Supplements (domain-specific)
Each AI gets an additional focused supplement extracted/derived from the core manual:

RA (Research Assistant): Decision frameworks, technology selection matrices, feasibility analysis patterns
AA (Architecture Assistant): Design patterns, API standards, system architecture best practices
SA (Security Assistant): Security controls, compliance mappings, threat modeling practices
IA (Implementation Assistant): Coding standards, testing methodologies, development workflows
QA (Quality Assistant): Testing strategies, validation frameworks, quality gates
DA (Deployment Assistant): DevOps practices, deployment patterns, operational procedures
DBA (Database Assistant): Data modeling, performance optimization, backup/recovery practices

Why This Works Best for Your System:
Advantages:

Consistency: All AIs work from the same foundational knowledge
Specialization: Each AI has deep, relevant practices for their domain
Efficiency: No duplication of universal practices across 8 separate manuals
Maintainability: Update core manual once, supplements as needed
Cross-domain Coordination: MC can reference any specialist area when coordinating
Compliance: Single source of truth for regulatory requirements

Implementation Strategy:

Have your research AI create the comprehensive core manual
Extract domain-specific sections into focused supplements
Store in your RAG system with clear indexing:
/best-practices/
â”œâ”€â”€ core-manual.md (all AIs reference this)
â”œâ”€â”€ ra-supplement.md 
â”œâ”€â”€ aa-supplement.md
â”œâ”€â”€ sa-supplement.md
â””â”€â”€ ... (etc)


RAG System Integration:

MC: Access to full core + all supplements (for coordination decisions)
Specialist AIs: Access to core + their specific supplement
Cross-referencing: Each supplement includes pointers to relevant core sections

This approach aligns perfectly with your modular RAG vision from the conversation log - each AI pulls exactly what it needs without information overload, while maintaining consistency across the entire system.
Would you like me to help design the structure for how to extract those seven specialized supplements from the comprehensive manual once your research AI completes it?RetryYthe rag vision is def not my vision, it was just a word that slipped out, cause its heavily buzzed and i wanted to undertand it. so tailoring the reserach specific to that, is not doing me a service. I just want to do what's the best and maybe rag is the best, i dont know.EditYou're absolutely right - I got caught up in the RAG buzzword instead of focusing on what actually works best for your system. Let me think about this more practically.
Looking at your MC system prompt, it's clear you have a sophisticated orchestration system where the MC needs to make informed decisions about technology choices, compliance, and coordination across 7 specialized AIs.
What Actually Makes Sense:
Single Comprehensive Manual for Everyone is probably the cleanest approach because:

Your MC is the decision-maker - it needs full context across all domains to coordinate effectively
Cross-domain decisions are common - security impacts architecture, architecture impacts implementation, etc.
Simpler maintenance - one source of truth to update
No knowledge gaps - any AI can understand what the others are doing
Easier debugging - when something goes wrong, everyone has the same reference point

The Real Question:
How do you prevent information overload? Your MC prompt already handles this well with its structured gate system and clear role boundaries. The AIs don't need filtered information - they need clear instructions on what parts to focus on for their specific tasks.
Instead of creating 8 different manuals, you'd give each AI clear instructions like:

"RA: Focus on sections 2-4 and 7 of the manual for your research tasks"
"SA: Reference sections 9, 12, and appendix C for security decisions"

This keeps it simple, maintains consistency, and lets each AI dive deep into their specialty while understanding the bigger picture.
Does this approach feel more aligned with what you're actually trying to build?
