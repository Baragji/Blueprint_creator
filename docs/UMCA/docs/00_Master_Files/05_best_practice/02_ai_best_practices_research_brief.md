# Software Engineering Best Practices Research Brief
**Date:** August 2025  
**For:** Research AI  
**Objective:** Compile a comprehensive manual/workbook on software engineering best practices

## Research Mission
Create a structured manual that removes vagueness from "best practices" by providing concrete, actionable rules for AI development systems. This manual should serve as a "business context package" that AI assistants can reference when making technical decisions.

## Critical Context: EU AI Act Compliance (August 2025 Update)
**PRIORITY:** As of August 2, 2025, the EU AI Act's major compliance requirements are now in effect. Your research MUST incorporate these new legal requirements:

### New EU AI Act Requirements (Effective August 2, 2025):
- **GPAI Model Compliance**: All General Purpose AI models must comply with transparency, documentation, and risk assessment requirements
- **Governance & Penalties**: Fines up to â‚¬35M or 7% of global turnover are now enforceable
- **Documentation Requirements**: Mandatory technical documentation and risk management systems
- **Transparency Obligations**: Clear disclosure when AI systems interact with users
- **Fundamental Rights Impact**: Mandatory assessments for high-risk AI applications

### Research Integration Required:
1. **Regulatory Compliance Section**: Dedicate substantial content to EU AI Act compliance practices
2. **Documentation Standards**: Include AI Act-compliant documentation templates and processes  
3. **Risk Assessment Frameworks**: Provide methodologies for AI risk evaluation
4. **Transparency Requirements**: Define best practices for AI system transparency
5. **Cross-Border Considerations**: Address compliance for international AI development teams

## Core Research Areas

### 1. Universal Best Practices
Research practices that apply regardless of technology stack:

- Performance optimization principles
- Error handling and logging
- Code review processes
- CI/CD pipeline standards

### 2. Language-Specific Best Practices
Research and document distinct practices for:

#### Python Development:
- PEP standards and style guides
- Type hinting best practices
- Virtual environment management

- Build tool configurations (Webpack, Vite, esbuild)
- Browser compatibility and polyfills

#### Cross-Language Considerations:
- API design and communication between services
- Microservices architecture patterns
- Containerization (Docker) best practices
- Database interaction patterns

### 3. Project Scale Considerations
Document how practices differ based on project size:

#### Small-Scale Projects (1-5 developers, <50k lines):
- Simplified workflow processes
- Essential tooling only
- Rapid prototyping practices
- Resource-conscious approaches

#### Medium-Scale Projects (5-20 developers, 50k-500k lines):
- Team collaboration protocols
- Code organization strategies
- Release management
- Documentation requirements

#### Large-Scale Projects (20+ developers, 500k+ lines):
- Enterprise architecture patterns
- Advanced CI/CD strategies
- Multi-team coordination
- Scalability and performance requirements
- Legacy code management

### 4. Application Type Considerations

#### Frontend Development:
- UI/UX best practices
- State management patterns
- Performance optimization (lazy loading, code splitting)
- Accessibility (WCAG) compliance
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile responsiveness

#### Backend Development:
- API design principles (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Database design and optimization
- Caching strategies
- Security practices (authentication, authorization)
- Scalability patterns
- Monitoring and observability

#### Full-Stack Development:
- Communication between frontend and backend
- Shared code and type definitions
- Development environment consistency
- Deployment strategies

### 5. Industry Standards and Decision Frameworks
Research when to use specific technologies:
- Language selection criteria by use case
- Framework selection matrices
- Database technology decision trees
- Infrastructure choices (cloud vs. on-premise)
- Third-party integration guidelines

### 6. AI Development Specific Practices
Given the EU AI Act requirements:
- ML model versioning and reproducibility
- Data governance and privacy
- AI system documentation and explainability
- Bias detection and mitigation
- AI system testing and validation
- Regulatory compliance workflows
- AI system monitoring and maintenance

### 7. Quality Assurance and Testing
- Test-driven development (TDD) practices
- Behavior-driven development (BDD) approaches
- Testing pyramid strategies
- Automated testing best practices
- Manual testing protocols
- Performance testing methodologies
- Security testing requirements

### 8. DevOps and Deployment
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Blue-green and canary deployments
- Environment management (dev, staging, prod)

### 9. Security Best Practices
- Secure coding principles
- Dependency management and vulnerability scanning
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Data encryption practices
- Compliance frameworks (GDPR, SOC2, ISO27001)
- Incident response procedures

### 10. Team and Process Management
- Agile development practices
- Code review guidelines
- Documentation standards
- Communication protocols
- Knowledge sharing practices
- Onboarding procedures

## Research Methodology Instructions

### Sources to Prioritize:
1. **Official Documentation**: Language-specific official guides, EU AI Act official documentation
2. **Industry Leaders**: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta engineering blogs
