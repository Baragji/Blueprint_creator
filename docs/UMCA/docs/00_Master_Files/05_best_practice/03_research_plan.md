## üß† Research AI Brief: "Best Practices Codex for AI-Orchestrated Software Development (v1.0 ‚Äì Aug 2025)"

### üîç Objective

Compile a comprehensive and actionable **Best Practices Codex** (target length: 40‚Äì60 pages) tailored for AI-driven software engineering. This codex will serve as the universal foundation for all AI agents involved in planning, coding, orchestrating, retrieving, testing, and deploying applications under the Master Coordinator (MC).

| **1. Coding Best Practices** | - Maximum line length per function/class/module |

```
                                 - When/how to break down large functions  
                                 - Naming conventions  
                                 - Folder structure and file naming  
                                 - When to abstract logic into modules or services  
                                 - Type safety and type annotations (Python, TypeScript)  
                                 - Test-driven development (TDD) workflow

\- Logging and tracking decisions                                                                                                                                     |
\| **5. RAG & Retrieval Use**       | - When AI is allowed to query retrieval
\- How retrieval augmentation should be logged
\- Formatting retrieved outputs into prompts
\- Avoiding hallucinated summaries
\- Guardrails for using retrieved facts vs. hardcoded guesses
\- Strategies for resolving conflicting sources                                                                                                                                     |
\| **6. File and Repo Conventions** | - Naming conventions (files, folders, config files)
\- `src/`, `lib/`, `utils/`, `types/`, `api/`, `services/`, `db/`, etc.
\- Git branching strategy
\- Pre-commit hook standards (lint, test, types, secrets)
\- Directory structures for multi-agent orchestration repos
\- Folder separation between:
\- core logic
\- orchestration
\- assistant definitions
\- config packages                                                                                                                               |
\| **7. Security & Validation**     | - Secure defaults
\- Input/output validation for every AI-generated file
\- Never trust AI-generated code without test
\- OpenSSF Scorecard & SLSA references
\- Hardening workflows for AI-generated endpoints, config, Dockerfiles                                                                                                                                        |

## üß© Format Specification

For each best practice, provide the following schema:

```json
{
  "pillar": "e.g. Code Hygiene, Orchestration, Retrieval Guardrails",
  "title": "Short title of the best practice",
  "description": "Clear explanation of the principle and why it matters",
  "appliesTo": ["Python", "TypeScript", "MC", "All"],
  "badExample": "Optional ‚Äì a common mistake or anti-pattern",
  "goodExample": "Optional ‚Äì a clean implementation or pattern",
  "source": "Link or citation if available (NIST, OWASP, GitHub RFC, etc.)"
}
```

---

## üì¶ Deliverable

* JSON file containing 200‚Äì300 best practice entries, following the schema above
* (Optional) Markdown or PDF summary sorted by pillar and language

---

## üß™ Quality Expectations

* Use only **validated**, **community-adopted** practices from real-world usage (not just theoretical).
* Include sourcing from:

  * Official standards (NIST, OWASP, SLSA, OpenSSF, ISO)
  * GitHub READMEs of top projects (e.g. LangChain, FastAPI, Next.js, React, NestJS)
  * AI orchestration systems like CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, ReAct, or TRAE if applicable
  * Reddit, Stack Overflow consensus for developer-validated workarounds or patterns
* Avoid overly verbose academic phrasing. Prioritize **actionable, developer-usable advice.**

---

## üß† Target Use

This codex will:

* Train or prime all future AI agents in the system
* Be dynamically accessible via RAG or config context
* Guide the Master Coordinator in orchestrating decisions and validating output
* Be used to enforce non-negotiable standards across all pipelines

---

## üöÄ Research Mode

* Enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for this task
* Set to high precision / low hallucination
* Enable validation against official sources
* Sort output by logical categories for fast access by downstream AI

---

## üí¨ Final Output Summary (Example Format)

```markdown
# Pillar: Code Hygiene

### üîπ Best Practice: "Keep Functions Short and Focused"
**Description**: Each function should do one thing and do it well. If a function exceeds 40 lines, it should be reviewed for possible decomposition.  
**Applies To**: ["Python", "TypeScript"]  
**Bad Example**: A 200-line handler combining DB access, business logic, and error formatting  
**Good Example**: A function with a single responsibility that delegates to helper services  
**Source**: https://github.com/google/styleguide
