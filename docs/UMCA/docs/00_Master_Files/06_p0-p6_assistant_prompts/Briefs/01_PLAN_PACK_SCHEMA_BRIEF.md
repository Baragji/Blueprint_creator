# TASK BRIEF 01: PLAN PACK SCHEMA & MANIFEST

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Target**: AI Assistant (Surgical Precision Standard)  
**Scope**: Create the Plan Pack schema and manifest that defines P0-P6 ‚Üí G0-G8 handoff structure  
**Deliverable**: Single JSON Schema file with documentation

---

## üéØ SINGLE TASK FOCUS

**Create**: `PLAN_PACK.schema.json` - The definitive schema for Plan Pack artifacts generated by P0-P6 phases

**Success Criteria**: 
- ‚â§200 lines JSON Schema (including descriptions)
- Validates the "Plan Pack" outputs from P0-P6 planning phases
- Enables G0-G8 development phases to consume planning outputs
- Concrete enough to implement immediately

---

## üìã REQUIRED SOURCE MATERIALS

**You MUST reference these exact files** (available in ROADMAP_COMPILATION/):

### Primary Requirements:
- `02b_FINAL_ROADMAP_EXCELLENCE_BRIEF.md` - Lines 33-47 specify Plan Pack requirements
- `HTML_Proof_of_Concept.html` - Shows P0-P6 planning concept visually

### Excellence Standard:
- `EXCELLENCE_METHODOLOGY_ANALYSIS_AND_REFERENCE.md` - Surgical precision methodology
- `8_SYSTEM_PROMPTS/` - Reference the G0-G8 assistant input requirements

### Context:
- `08_gpts_response.md` - Your own gap analysis and remediation plan (lines 33-35)

---

## üéØ SPECIFIC DELIVERABLE

**File**: `PLAN_PACK.schema.json`

**Must contain schemas for these components** (from your gap analysis):
1. **problem-brief** - Structured problem definition
2. **constraints** - Technical/business constraints
3. **options matrix** - Evaluated solution options  
4. **decision record** - Final decisions with rationale
5. **risks** - Risk assessment and mitigations
6. **acceptance criteria** - Success definitions
7. **operating model** - How the solution will operate
8. **compliance baseline** - Regulatory/security requirements

**Format**: JSON Schema (draft-07 or later)  
**Validation**: Must be able to run `jsonschema -i example.json PLAN_PACK.schema.json`

---

## üìñ CONTEXT FROM YOUR ANALYSIS

From `08_gpts_response.md` lines 33-35:
> "Define Plan Pack (artifacts and schemas)
> - Outputs: plan-pack.manifest.json (schema), components: problem-brief, constraints, options matrix, decision record, risks, acceptance criteria, operating model, compliance baseline.
> - Success: jsonschema-validated; checksums recorded."

**This is your specification** - implement it precisely.

---

## ‚ö° INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

**P0-P6 Planning Phases** (future) will generate Plan Pack JSON conforming to this schema  
**G0-G8 Development Phases** (existing 8 system prompts) will consume Plan Pack as input

**Critical**: Reference the `SESSION_HANDOFF` format used by the 8 existing system prompts to ensure compatibility.

---

## üîç VALIDATION TEST

Your schema must validate this structure:
```json
{
  "planPackId": "string",
  "version": "string", 
  "problemBrief": { ... },
  "constraints": { ... },
  "optionsMatrix": [ ... ],
  "decisionRecord": { ... },
  "risks": [ ... ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [ ... ],
  "operatingModel": { ... },
  "complianceBaseline": { ... },
  "checksums": { ... }
}
```

---

## üö® CONSTRAINTS

- **‚â§200 lines** total (including descriptions and examples)
- **JSON Schema only** - no additional files
- **Self-documenting** - descriptions explain each field's purpose
- **Immediately implementable** - concrete enough to code against

---

## üìã DELIVERY FORMAT

1. **Single file**: `PLAN_PACK.schema.json`
2. **Brief commentary** (‚â§100 words) on design decisions
3. **Validation command** to test the schema

---

**FOCUS**: This is a surgical precision task. One schema. One deliverable. Reference the exact source files listed above.

**Next**: After this succeeds, we'll tackle P0 Planning Assistant creation separately.
