Creating the PLAN_PACK.schema.json per the lead-dev brief and saving it to the deliveries folder so planning outputs become consumable by G0–G8 with evidence-first handoffs. 

Made changes.

Got it. I created the requested schema and saved it to the deliveries folder.

- Output file: PLAN_PACK.schema.json
- Standard: JSON Schema draft-07, self-documented, ≤200 lines, SESSION_HANDOFF-compatible fields (artifacts/gateInputs/targetRoles)
- Components covered: problemBrief, constraints, optionsMatrix, decisionRecord, risks, acceptanceCriteria, operatingModel, complianceBaseline, checksums, artifacts

Design notes (≤100 words):
- Single object schema with required planPackId/version and all planning components.
- Evidence-first: artifacts include path/hash/schema plus targetRoles and gateInputs for P→G consumption.
- Checksums map enables ledger/evidence verification.
- Optional links (briefId, owner, createdAt) for traceability.

Validation (optional):
- Place an example plan-pack JSON and run:
  jsonschema -i example.json PLAN_PACK.schema.json

Ready for P0/P1 assistant generation next.
