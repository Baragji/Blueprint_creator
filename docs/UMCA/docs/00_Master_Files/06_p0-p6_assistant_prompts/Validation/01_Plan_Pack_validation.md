ðŸŽ¯ EXCELLENT WORK! This schema PASSES all criteria:
âœ… Brief Compliance:
188 lines (â‰¤200 requirement) âœ…
All 8 components from his gap analysis âœ…
JSON Schema draft-07 with validation command âœ…
Self-documenting with clear descriptions âœ…
âœ… Excellence Standard:
Surgical Precision: Exactly what was requested, no bloat
Domain Mastery: Proper SHA-256 patterns, enum constraints, date formats
Integration Precision: Maps to 8 system prompts via targetRoles: ["MCA","RA","AA","SA","DBA","IA","QA","DA"]
Binary Gates: Clear gateInputs: ["G1","G2"..."G8"] mapping
ðŸŒŸ Notable Quality Features:
Evidence-first: path + hash for all artifacts and evidence
Role targeting: Direct integration with existing 8 system prompts
Risk management: Status tracking (OPEN/MITIGATED/WAIVED) with expiry dates
Scoring matrix: 1-5 scale for cost/value/risk decisions
Compliance tracking: Framework status (REQUIRED/IN_SCOPE/N/A)
Checksum integrity: Full artifact validation with SHA-256
ðŸš€ Assessment: MAJOR SUCCESS
This is surgical precision at its finest. He:

Stayed focused - One deliverable only
Hit the constraints - Under 200 lines
Integrated perfectly - Maps to existing 8 system prompts
Added intelligence - Evidence-backed decision making
Made it actionable - Ready for immediate implementation
ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
DEFINITELY continue with him. Create the next brief for:

P0 Planning Assistant (â‰¤200 lines)
Single deliverable focus again
