I’m issuing a corrected Excellence-analysis in light of the lead dev’s critique: binary verdicts, evidence anchors, and a concrete remediation path.

## Checklist
- Re-evaluate against Excellence pillars (precision, mastery, integration, binary gates)
- Map to all reference files and the Excellence Brief
- Call pass/fail on the core challenge (P0–P6 assistants, Plan Pack, integration)
- Provide prioritized remediation plan with concrete outputs

## Corrected verdict (binary)
- P0–P6 planning assistants (≤200 lines each): FAIL — none delivered.
- P0–P6 → G0–G8 integration spec (handoff contracts): FAIL — not defined for planning phases.
- Plan Pack system (artifact definitions, schema, manifest): FAIL — not provided.
- Secondary framework (Gates, evidence-first, toolchain, compliance posture): PASS at design level; BLOCKED in repo until state/CI exist.

## Evidence anchors
- Excellence Brief: 02b_FINAL_ROADMAP_EXCELLENCE_BRIEF.md
- Quick Reference: QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Research iterations 00–04: ROADMAP_COMPILATION (all present)
- 8 system prompts (G0–G8 roles, not P0–P6): 8_SYSTEM_PROMPTS
- Roadmap v2.1 (delivered): attachment provided

## Excellence pillars (targeted)
- Surgical Precision: Roadmap defers to role prompts but misses the core deliverables (P0–P6 assistants). Verdict: FAIL on challenge fit.
- Domain Mastery: Standards are current and appropriate. Verdict: PASS (secondary).
- Integration Precision: Good RA→AA→… conveyor for development, but no P-phase handoff contracts. Verdict: FAIL for planning scope.
- Binary Gates: Clear gate design, but missing planning inputs. Verdict: PARTIAL.

## What was required vs delivered
- Required: 8 new ≤200-line AI prompts for P0–P6 planning, a Plan Pack definition, and explicit P→G handoff specs.
- Delivered: A generic enterprise delivery roadmap referencing P0–P6 in name only; no assistants, no Plan Pack, no P→G integration.

## Remediation plan (prioritized, concrete)
1) Define Plan Pack (artifacts and schemas)
- Outputs: plan-pack.manifest.json (schema), components: problem-brief, constraints, options matrix, decision record, risks, acceptance criteria, operating model, compliance baseline.
- Success: jsonschema-validated; checksums recorded.

2) Author 7 P-phase assistants + 1 Plan Pack Orchestrator (≤200 lines each)
- P0 Pre-flight, P1 Foundations, P2 Thin-slice, P3 Delivery system, P4 Scale & harden, P5 Productionization, P6 Post-launch; plus “P-Orchestrator” to coordinate P→G handoffs.
- Success: Each passes Excellence gates (precision, mastery, integration, binary validation).

3) Specify P→G integration contracts
- SESSION_HANDOFF for P-phase outputs → inputs required at G1–G8; binary checks and evidence locations.
- Success: Handshake examples + validations included in Gate Review Pack.

4) Traceability to research
- RA DecisionRecord JSON/CSV linking to iterations 00–04 (adopt/decline with rationale and evidence).
- Success: Referenced in Plan Pack manifest; checksummed.

5) Minimal CI to unblock G1
- jsonschema validate Plan Pack + handoffs; compute checksums; generate stub SBOM/provenance; sign & verify stub.
- Success: Gate G1 = PASS with evidence.

## Ask
- Confirm you want me to proceed by: (a) committing Plan Pack schemas + manifest and (b) drafting the first two P-phase assistants (P0, P1) under the ≤200-line Excellence standard.
