# Research Task Brief: RA-G0Strategy

**Task ID**: RA-G0Strategy  
**Objective**: Research and recommend optimal technology stack for Enterprise Task Management API  
**Context**: UMCA demonstration project requiring production-grade API with authentication, CRUD operations, and enterprise compliance standards.

## Deliverables

### Required Research Areas
1. **Backend Framework Analysis**
   - Compare Node.js/Express vs FastAPI vs Spring Boot
   - Focus on enterprise features, security, testing ecosystem
   - Performance benchmarks for CRUD operations

2. **Database Technology**
   - Compare PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs SQLite for task management
   - Consider ACID compliance, scalability, enterprise support

3. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Compare JWT vs OAuth2 vs Session-based
   - Security implications and enterprise compliance

4. **Testing & Quality Stack**
   - Unit testing frameworks comparison
   - Integration testing approaches
   - Security scanning tool options

5. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Containerization approach (Docker)
   - Basic monitoring and logging strategy

## Constraints
- Must support TDD methodology
- Must integrate with UMCA CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Must support SAST scanning, SBOM generation
- Budget: $0 (open source only)
- Timeline: Production deployment within 4-6 development cycles

## Expected Outputs
- **3-5 technology stack options** with pros/cons analysis
- **Single recommended choice** with detailed rationale
- **5-8 implementation phases** for G1-G8 progression
- **Risk assessment** for enterprise deployment
- **Citations** from authoritative sources (OWASP, NIST, vendor docs)

## Done When
- UMCA has clear technology decisions with implementation roadmap
- Risk factors identified with mitigation strategies
- Evidence package includes research citations and decision matrix

## G-Gate Context
**G0 Strategy & Risk Scoping** - This research enables G1 Architecture phase
